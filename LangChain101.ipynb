    "\n",
    "Prompt templates help to translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model. This can be used to guide a model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Templates output a PromptValue. This PromptValue can be passed to an LLM or a ChatModel, and can also be cast to a string or a list of messages. The reason this PromptValue exists is to make it easy to switch between strings and messages.\n",
    "\n",
    " - #### ChatPromptTemplates\n",
    "\n",
    "  These prompt templates are used to format a list of messages. These \"templates\" consist of a list of templates themselves. For example, a common way to construct and use a ChatPromptTemplate is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n",
    "\n",
    "prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\n",
    "    (\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant\"),\n",
    "    (\"user\", \"Tell me a joke about {topic}\")\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "prompt_template.invoke({\"topic\": \"cats\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MessagePlaceholder\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt template is responsible for adding a list of messages in a particular place. In the above ChatPromptTemplate, we saw how we could format two messages, each one a string. But what if we wanted the user to pass in a list of messages that we would slot into a particular spot? This is how you use MessagesPlaceholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "### Chat history\n",
    "\n",
    "Most LLM applications have a conversational interface. An essential component of a conversation is being able to refer to information introduced earlier in the conversation. At bare minimum, a conversational system should be able to access some window of past messages directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of `ChatHistory` refers to a class in LangChain which can be used to wrap an arbitrary chain. This `ChatHistory` will keep track of inputs and outputs of the underlying chain, and append them as messages to a message database. Future interactions will then load those messages and pass them into the chain as part of the input."

       "'**The Uninvited Gaze**\\n\\nReynier poured another round of juice for the guests, his eyes scanning the room with a practiced ease. The party was in full swing, with his mother\\'s colleagues chatting and laughing together. Ankur\\'s mom, Arti, was holding court in the corner, her bright smile and infectious laughter drawing everyone in. Reynier\\'s eyes met hers, and he felt a familiar warmth spread through his chest.\\n\\nAs he continued to serve the guests, Reynier found himself drawn to the women in the room, all of whom were wearing tight-fitting jeans. He loved the way the fabric hugged their curves, accentuating their figures. The sight was almost hypnotic, and he found himself getting lost in the sea of denim.\\n\\nBut just as he was getting comfortable, he heard the sound of heels clicking on the floor. Reynier\\'s heart skipped a beat as he turned to see his mother, Renuka, walking towards him. She was wearing a pair of jeans that was so tight, it seemed to be painted onto her skin. The faded thighs only added to the allure, making him feel like he was gazing at a work of art.\\n\\nReynier was frozen in place, his eyes glued to his mother\\'s legs. He had never seen her look so...different. The tight jeans accentuated her curves in a way that was both shocking and mesmerizing. His mind went blank, and all he could think about was the image of his mother in jeans.\\n\\nThe thoughts swirled in his head like a vortex, refusing to let him go. He replayed the moment over and over in his mind, his brain struggling to comprehend what he had just seen. The image of his mom in jeans was etched into his memory, and he knew it would haunt him for a long time to come.\\n\\nAs the night wore on, Reynier found himself lost in his own thoughts, his mind racing with questions and emotions. It wasn\\'t until Arti approached him, a mischievous glint in her eye, that he snapped back to reality.\\n\\n\"Hey, Reynier, I have to tell you something,\" she said, her voice low and conspiratorial. \"I was the one who suggested your mom wear those jeans today.\"\\n\\nReynier\\'s eyes locked onto hers, a mixture of surprise and gratitude washing over him. \"Why?\" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\\n\\nArti smiled, her eyes sparkling with amusement. \"Because I knew it would surprise you, of course. And a little bit because I wanted to see the look on your face.\"\\n\\nReynier felt his face heat up, and he looked away, trying to process the revelation. He knew that his mother had always been traditional, but he had never expected her to wear jeans. And yet, here she was, rocking the look like it was her own personal style.\\n\\nAs the party wound down and the guests began to leave, Reynier couldn\\'t help but feel a sense of wonder and awe. His mother, the sari-clad, traditional woman he had always known, had just revealed a whole new side of herself. And Reynier knew that his perception of her would never be the same again.'"

His mother, Renuka, was busy preparing lunch in the kitchen, her long, dark hair tied back in a neat bun, a bright yellow sari flowing around her like a river of sunshine. He had always loved the way she looked in traditional clothes - it was as if she had been born to wear them.\\n\\nAs he sat on the couch, flipping through a fashion magazine, Reynier\\'s mind began to wander back to the countless times he had asked his mother why she didn\\'t wear jeans like his friends\\' mothers. He was only eight then, but he remembered the look she had given him - a mix of disappointment and amusement.\\n\\n\"Jeans don\\'t suit me, beta,\" she had said, her voice firm but gentle. \"I\\'m a tall and curvy woman, and jeans just don\\'t flatter me. Besides, I like being traditional.\"\\n\\nReynier had nodded, but he couldn\\'t shake off the feeling that his mother was missing out on something. All the other mothers he saw wore jeans, and they looked so cool and modern. Why couldn\\'t his mother be like that too?\\n\\nAs he grew older, Reynier\\'s fascination with jeans only grew stronger. He would often sneak peeks at his friends\\' mothers, marveling at how effortlessly they pulled off the casual look. And then, there was Ankur, his childhood friend who lived in the neighborhood. Ankur\\'s mother, Arti, was the only one who wore jeans in their neighborhood, and Reynier had always been drawn to her carefree spirit.\\n\\nIt was Ankur who had first introduced him to the world of jeans. They were both 12 years old then, and Ankur had invited Reynier over to his place for a sleepover. As they were getting ready for bed, Reynier had caught a glimpse of Arti, Ankur\\'s mother, wearing a pair of tight-fitting jeans. Something about the way she looked had caught his attention, and Reynier had felt a strange flutter in his chest.\\n\\nIt was his first realization that he was attracted to women who wore jeans. And from that day on, Reynier had made it his mission to understand the appeal of jeans. Little did he know that his fascination would lead him down a path of self-discovery, one that would challenge his beliefs and values, and ultimately change him forever.',\n",

       "('**The Uninvited Gaze**\\n\\nReynier poured another round of juice for the guests, his eyes scanning the room with a practiced ease. The party was in full swing, with his mother\\'s colleagues chatting and laughing together. Ankur\\'s mom, Arti, was holding court in the corner, her bright smile and infectious laughter drawing everyone in. Reynier\\'s eyes met hers, and he felt a familiar warmth spread through his chest.\\n\\nAs he continued to serve the guests, Reynier found himself drawn to the women in the room, all of whom were wearing tight-fitting jeans. He loved the way the fabric hugged their curves, accentuating their figures. The sight was almost hypnotic, and he found himself getting lost in the sea of denim.\\n\\nBut just as he was getting comfortable, he heard the sound of heels clicking on the floor. Reynier\\'s heart skipped a beat as he turned to see his mother, Renuka, walking towards him. She was wearing a pair of jeans that was so tight, it seemed to be painted onto her skin. The faded thighs only added to the allure, making him feel like he was gazing at a work of art.\\n\\nReynier was frozen in place, his eyes glued to his mother\\'s legs. He had never seen her look so...different. The tight jeans accentuated her curves in a way that was both shocking and mesmerizing. His mind went blank, and all he could think about was the image of his mother in jeans.\\n\\nThe thoughts swirled in his head like a vortex, refusing to let him go. He replayed the moment over and over in his mind, his brain struggling to comprehend what he had just seen. The image of his mom in jeans was etched into his memory, and he knew it would haunt him for a long time to come.\\n\\nAs the night wore on, Reynier found himself lost in his own thoughts, his mind racing with questions and emotions. It wasn\\'t until Arti approached him, a mischievous glint in her eye, that he snapped back to reality.\\n\\n\"Hey, Reynier, I have to tell you something,\" she said, her voice low and conspiratorial. \"I was the one who suggested your mom wear those jeans today.\"\\n\\nReynier\\'s eyes locked onto hers, a mixture of surprise and gratitude washing over him. \"Why?\" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\\n\\nArti smiled, her eyes sparkling with amusement. \"Because I knew it would surprise you, of course. And a little bit because I wanted to see the look on your face.\"\\n\\nReynier felt his face heat up, and he looked away, trying to process the revelation. He knew that his mother had always been traditional, but he had never expected her to wear jeans. And yet, here she was, rocking the look like it was her own personal style.\\n\\nAs the party wound down and the guests began to leave, Reynier couldn\\'t help but feel a sense of wonder and awe. His mother, the sari-clad, traditional woman he had always known, had just revealed a whole new side of herself. And Reynier knew that his perception of her would never be the same again.',\n",

He slid out of bed and into his boxer shorts, his eyes drifting back to his mother. She was still wearing the tight jeans from the party, and for a moment, he forgot to breathe.\\n\\nAs they walked out of the house, the early morning sun casting a golden glow over the lush green lawn, Reynier couldn\\'t help but steal glances at his mother\\'s posterior. The tight jeans accentuated her curves in a way that was both tantalizing and mesmerizing. He felt a familiar tingling in his groin, and his mind began to wander down a path he didn\\'t want to explore.\\n\\nRenuka, oblivious to her son\\'s gaze, walked with a confident stride, her long dark hair flowing behind her like a river of night. Her sari-clad friends might have been traditional, but Renuka\\'s wear of jeans had given her a newfound sense of freedom. She moved with a newfound swagger, her hips swaying gently as she walked.\\n\\nAs they strolled through the park, Reynier found himself lost in the rhythm of his mother\\'s walk. He loved the way her jeans hugged her curves, making her look like a woman half her age. He felt a pang of jealousy towards the jeans, wondering why they got to be so close to his mother\\'s skin.\\n\\nReynier\\'s eyes followed the curve of her hips, his mind racing with thoughts he couldn\\'t quite articulate. He felt like he was walking on shaky ground, and he wasn\\'t sure how to steady himself. All he knew was that he couldn\\'t take his eyes off his mother, and the tantalizing sight of her in tight jeans.'"

      "The sewing machine hummed, a comforting rhythm that filled Reynier's small studio apartment with a familiar warmth. Swathes of silk lay draped over the worn armchair, a riot of emerald and sapphire hues that shimmered under the warm glow of the overhead lamp. But Reynier's eyes weren't drawn to the luxurious fabrics that were his passion. Instead, his gaze lingered on the pair of faded denim jeans tossed carelessly on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He picked them up, the worn denim rough against his fingertips. These weren't just any jeans. These belonged to Ankur, his friend, confidante, and fellow fashion enthusiast. They represented a rebellion, a casual coolness that Reynier craved but could never quite grasp. \n",
      "\n",
      "It all stemmed back to that day, twelve years ago, in Ankur's living room. Ankur's mom, Arti, had breezed in, a whirlwind of laughter and denim. Reynier, a shy, lanky seven-year-old, had felt a strange unfamiliar pull, a warmth spreading through his chest as he watched her move. That was the day he discovered the potent allure of denim, an allure intrinsically linked to the women in his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "His mother, Renuka, was a vision in her elegant sarees and flowing salwars. She carried herself with a regal grace, her every movement exuding the essence of tradition. He loved her dearly, admired her strength and resilience, yet a part of him couldn't help but wonder what she would look like in a pair of jeans. \n",
      "\n",
      "The thought had, of course, been voiced when he was younger, met with a gentle, \"Jeans don't suit me, beta.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "He knew she was right.  Finding jeans in her size would be impossible, the hourglass figure that turned heads in a sari completely ignored by manufacturers who favored mass-produced uniformity. Still, the image of his mother, effortlessly stylish in denim, refused to fade from his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He ran his fingers along the faded fabric of Ankur's jeans. His friends teased him mercilessly about his mother's old-fashioned ways, but Reynier saw it differently. He saw the beauty in her traditions, the elegance she exuded. But he also saw the allure of denim, the way it hugged curves and moved with the body, a silent rebellion against societal norms. \n",
      "\n",
      "And in that moment, an idea sparked within him, a design challenge that set his pulse racing. He would create the perfect pair of jeans, not for the masses, but for the women in his life, starting with his mother. Jeans that embraced their individuality, their strength, their unique beauty. It was a challenge he was determined to conquer, a denim dream woven from love, admiration, and a touch of rebellion. \n",

Her youthful appearance often led people to mistake her for his sister, and Reynier felt a surge of pride knowing that his mom was still so vibrant and beautiful.\\n\\nWalking behind her, Reynier\\'s gaze drifted back to her butt, and he felt his erection growing.

He felt a mix of emotions: excitement, embarrassment, and a deep sense of shame. He knew he had to get control of himself, but for now, he was trapped in the midst of his own desire.\\n\\nAs they walked, Renuka\\'s long, dark hair swung gently behind her, and her sari-clad friends might have envied the way her jeans accentuated her curves.

Your mom\\'s a stylish woman, and I\\'m sure she\\'ll look great in jeans. You\\'ll just have to get used to it.\"\\n\\nReynier sighed, feeling a mix of emotions. He still wasn\\'t sure how he felt about his mom wearing jeans, but he was trying to be more open-minded. Maybe Ankur was right, and he would get used to it with time.'"

    "LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model's cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)."

    "\n",
    " 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#text-splitters) break large Documents into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won't fit in a model's finite context window.\n",
    "\n",
    " At a high level, text splitters work as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Split the text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often sentences).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Start combining these small chunks into a larger chunk until you reach a certain size (as measured by some function).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Once you reach that size, make that chunk its own piece of text and then start creating a new chunk of text with some overlap (to keep context between chunks).\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#vector-stores) and [Embeddings model](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#embedding-models).\n",
    "\n",
    " The Embeddings class is a class designed for interfacing with text embedding models. There are many different embedding model providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) and local models, and this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    " > The base Embeddings class in LangChain provides two methods: one for embedding documents and one for embedding a query. The former takes as input multiple texts, while the latter takes a single text. The reason for having these as two separate methods is that some embedding providers have different embedding methods for documents (to be searched over) vs queries (the search query itself)."
